# Traffic-Signs-Recognition
This is a complete project which helps autonomous cars to identify the traffic signs.\n
This projects includes building a convolutional Neural Network and get it trained with the train data and then test the data to get to know the efficiency.
The Training and test is data is taken from kaggle. 
This Dataset has around 50k images with labels associated with it. It contains 43 different classes of ttraffic signs.
After training the data and testing it, The model can be saved, which in this case is **traffic_classifier.h5**.
In order to use the model for different images, a **GUI** is developed so that it can be used with ease.
**Convolutional Neural Network contains combination of these layers which can be used from Python Keras Library:
1.Conv2D layer
2.Maxpool2D layer
3.DropOut layer
4.Flatten Layer**(to flatten the model).
**GUI is built using tkinter.**
