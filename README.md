# Traffic-Signs-Recognition

This is a complete project which helps autonomous cars to identify the traffic signs.<br />
This projects includes building a convolutional Neural Network and get it trained with the train data and then test the data to get to know the efficiency.<br />
The Training and test is data is taken from kaggle. <br />
This Dataset has around 50k images with labels associated with it. It contains 43 different classes of ttraffic signs.<br />
After training the data and testing it, The model can be saved, which in this case is **traffic_classifier.h5**.<br />
In order to use the model for different images, a **GUI** is developed so that it can be used with ease.<br />
**Convolutional Neural Network contains combination of these layers which can be used from Python Keras Library:<br />
1.Conv2D layer<br />
2.Maxpool2D layer<br />
3.DropOut layer<br />
4.Flatten Layer**(to flatten the model).<br />

**GUI is built using tkinter.**
